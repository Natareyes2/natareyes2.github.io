        <!-- First Paragraph -->
        <p>I'm from <strong>Colombia</strong>, I'm 21 years old. I came to <em>Canada</em> and made my dreams come true. I would like to learn a lot of things, and for that reason, I picked this program, It is very broad and has several fields of action, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic Design</li>
            <li>Web Development</li> 
            <li>Photography</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <!-- Second Paragraph -->
        <p>I arrived in Canada on August 26<sup>th</sup>, so this is going to be my first <b>winter</b>, I'm super excited, and I hope to survive and enjoy the season. I would like to do some activities in the snow and get some different experiences. I will try to exercise this season to avoid falling into depression.</p>
    

        <!-- Third Paragraph -->
        <p>In my free time, I love listening to music, dancing, watching movies, and getting outside with my friends, and taking some pictures. When I was in my country I took a course in photography and I'm falling in love with this activity. One of my dreams is to open a cafe with desserts, it includes live music, and the caf√© will have a vintage appearance, I would like it to be very warm so that people can enjoy their stay there.</p>
